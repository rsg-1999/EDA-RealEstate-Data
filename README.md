# Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project analyzes real estate data from King County, Seattle, to uncover trends and provide actionable recommendations for a client. Key analyses include:
- Identifying factors influencing property prices.
- Testing hypotheses about property features and location.
- Generating tailored recommendations based on client preferences.


## Requirements

- pyenv
- python==3.11.3

## Setup

One of the first steps when starting any data science project is to create a virtual environment. For this project you have to create this environment from scratch yourself. However, you should be already familiar with the commands you will need to do so. The general workflow consists of... 

* setting the python version locally to 3.11.3
* creating a virtual environment using the `venv` module
* activating your newly created environment 
* upgrading `pip` (This step is not absolutely necessary, but will save you trouble when installing some packages.)
* installing the required packages via `pip`

Following the above steps you can create an identical environment on your own computer in order to be able to run your code without running into errors. 

## Set up your Environment
This repo contains a requirements.txt file with a list of all the packages and dependencies you will need.

Before you can start with plotly in Jupyter Lab you have to install node.js (if you haven't done it before).
- Check **Node version**  by run the following commands:
    ```sh
    node -v
    ```
    If you haven't installed it yet, begin at `step_1`. Otherwise, proceed to `step_2`.


### **`macOS`** type the following commands : 


- `Step_1:` Update Homebrew and install Node by following commands:
    ```sh
    brew update
    brew install node
    ```

- `Step_2:` Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands:

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### **`WindowsOS`** type the following commands :


- `Step_1:` Update Chocolatey and install Node by following commands:
    ```sh
    choco upgrade chocolatey
    choco install nodejs
    ```

- `Step_2:` Install the virtual environment and the required packages by following commands.

   For `PowerShell` CLI :

    ```PowerShell
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    For `Git-Bash` CLI :
  
    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 

 **`Note:`**
    If you encounter an error when trying to run `pip install --upgrade pip`, try using the following command:

   ```Bash
   python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
